# theLinaMorganFreemanProject


**Goal:**

Fun, learn.

**Question:**

What funny names can be created from blending other names?

For example: 

Take Meg Ryan and Ryan Reynolds.

Blend them.

No you've got MEG RYAN REYNOLDS!!! 

BTW, the name of this project comes from the mythical blending from Muchachada Nui. 

**Some results:**
Blending from american performers:
* Aaron Paul Newman		
* Kurt Russell Crowe	
* Steve Martin Lawrence	
* Daniel Craig Robinson	
* Meg Ryan Reynolds	
* Bruce Lee Marvin	
* Christopher Lee Marvin	
* Kristin Scott Thomas Mitchell	
* Stockard Channing Tatum	
* Clive Owen Wilson	
* Liv Tyler Perry	
* Aaron Paul Walker	
* Elizabeth Taylor Kitsch	
* Carmen Miranda Richardson	
* Kevin James Spader	
* Sarah Jessica Parker Posey	


**Data sources:**

In the datasets folder we have a 'Four million performer list', extracted from the dataset [name.basics.tsv](https://datasets.imdbws.com/), property of IMDb.

For the simple example included in the code, we have a sample from it.

Beware: if you try to use the whole dataset, you'll get a sweet 10 TB file with results.
